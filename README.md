## Welcome 👋
I am a *(front-end leaning)* fullstack developer with previous experience in design.

I recently completed [Brainstation's software engineering](https://brainstation.io/online/software-engineering-bootcamp) bootcamp.

- 👨🏾‍💻 I love working with [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/), [React](https://react.dev/), [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/about), [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) and [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- 🔭 In future, I'd like to explore [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/?hp=tile&tile=solutions), [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- 📫 You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richardacquaye/)
